<p>Hello Everyone. My name is James Woods, no relation, Family Guy jokes welcome. I work for Adobe in my professional life but I work on nothing related to what most people think when they think Adobe. In fact, if it weren&apos;t for this degree I would probably rarely touch Photoshop or Illustrator. Can you believe it. I do use Acrobat all the time though but I am sorry to say I cannot help you troubleshoot it. Man, what good am I! I also apologize in advance for all of the requests to update your software. So what do I do exactly? My experience is on the Digital Marketing side of the house, Analytics and A/B testing etc. My hobbies include...well finishing my homework at FullSail. </p>

<h2 id="title">Navigation</h2>

<img src="images/Navigation.png" alt="Layout and Images" style="width:75%;height:4%;">


<h2>Target Audience</h2>


<p>Given that the site is for the selling of antiques I would have to say that they are targeting an older and more affluent crowd ages 40+ and perhaps history buffs and professors with a fair amount discretionary income. I would imagine if they had a partnership with the antiques roadshow they could really broaden their audience provided their inventory catered to all price ranges.  </p>

<p>Given the non-traditional layout this site would almost certainly appeal to individual consumers B to C and not businesses, B to B. No gender differences here but the age range would not be all inclusive if certain premises are taken as true, namely younger internet users ages 6 to 40 invite instead of shun non-traditional layouts and other novelties whereas older users 40+ prefer what they have grown up with and what mirrors traditional print layout. A case could be made however that older users also enjoy novelty but perhaps only in moderation.</p>


<h2 >Client/User Needs</h2>


<p>The client would like to generate revenue through the sale of antiques. The users need a readily identifiable way of localizing their content views to the different categories of antiques they may be interested in purchasing.</p>

<h2>Critique</h2>

<p>Dominance of the navigation bar is achieved through positioning. It is present just below the hero image instead of at the top or the left and actually ends up right at eye level on a 17-inch monitor. The subtle shadow effect behind the bar also contributes to its dominance by making it appear to come off the page. The flat design of the bar itself tempers the three-dimensional effect so that it does not become gaudy and distracting. If any more 3d effects and/or aggressive color gradients were applied the end result would be a component that contrasts too much with the overall design. The Serif font adds even more class to the nav titles and the earth tone mahogany background compliments that class with a sense of refinement and a feeling of warmth. The other interesting functional thing about the navigation bar is that it is more of a product finding method then a navigation bar in that the menu is focused purely on product categories and doesn&apos;t include links to Home or About Us. The intent is to as simply and as straightforwardly as possible allow users you to begin their hunt for antiques.</p>

<h2 id="title">Home Page Layout</h2>

<img src="images/layoutandcolor.png" alt="Layout and Images" style="width:100%;height:4%;">

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>Given the non-traditional layout this site would almost certainly appeal to individual consumers B to C and not businesses, B to B. No gender differences here but the age range would not be all inclusive if certain premises are taken as true, namely younger internet users ages 6 to 40 invite instead of shun non-traditional layouts and other novelties whereas older users 40+ prefer what they have grown up with and what mirrors traditional print layout. A case could be made however that older users also enjoy novelty but perhaps only in moderation. The emphasis on the mission statement is interesting and to my mind reinforces a targeted consumer audience, and in this case an audience that takes the time to casually peruse the site instead of perform a hit and run dash for information or a quick transaction. If repeat visitors were identifiable on the site it would make sense to exchange the mission statement with something else of similar or only slightly less importance or get rid of it all together. Once your users are repeating visits it makes sense to now bring new content and transactional items front and center but as a landing page for new users the design certainly catches the eye by virtue of its non-traditional layout.</p>

<h2>Client/User Needs</h2>


<p>The client need here is to present only three key pieces of information, the company's name, mission statement and menu with an emphasis on the mission statement. That emphasis is made by the size and placement of the mission statement on the page. Users need to be able to understand what the company is all about and then begin exploring their offerings should they find the content appealing.</p>

<h2>Critique</h2>

<p>This page is asymmetrically balanced and therefore draws your attention to the mission statement and/or important message. The proportion of space devoted to this element in relation to the rest of the items causes ones attention to be drawn to it immediately. The space between the three main elements also clearly delineates each as being separate and distinct. Taken together the page hierarchy certainly draws ones attention to the middle and then either redirects the user to the left or right. The contrasting bright white font of the title along with its nearly complete vertical occupation of the left edge puts it in strong competition for the viewer&apos;s attention with the menu on the right, which also has contrasting font, but of smaller size. I can imagine people responding differently to those second and third elements based on personal preferences.</p>

<h2 id="title">CTA</h2>


<img src="images/CTA.png" alt="Layout and Images" style="width:75%;height:4%;">

<h2>Target Audience</h2>


<p>The avid jogger between the ages of 22 and 45 that is tech savvy and always looking to improve his or her performance and that is active in social media.</p>


<h2>Client/User Needs</h2>


<p>The client would like to offer ad space for retailers of consumer jogging products and jogging organizations that host jogging events. The user would like to have a portal where they can track their progress against goals they have set for themselves on a regular basis and communicate that progress to friends. The call to action in this case is specifically used to acknowledge the successful completion of a goal.</p>

<h2>Critique</h2>

<p>This CTA achieves dominance on the page primarily through its size in relation to other objects and its contrasting color. It is rather large as CTA&apos;s go, perhaps a little larger than normal and maybe not appropriate for sites that have more content to show or that have multiple CTA&apos;s unless of course you wanted this one to be at the top of the hierarchy of calls to action. The very subtle shadow affect is a nice touch but it doesn&apos;t contribute to the buttons conspicuousness nearly as much as the blurring affect that outlines the button as well as the horizontal line that extends across the whole page anchoring the button in the middle.  The blurring affect could be quite useful in many design situations in that it allows the CTA to both blend into and stand out on the page simultaneously. I think this would be very good when positioned in front of a background with a picture however it might work with other backgrounds. The anchoring line is a limited use case though in my opinion, especially if the button is not front and center.</p>

<h2 id="title">Testimonials</h2>

<img src="images/Testimonials.png" alt="Layout and Images" style="width:75%;height:4%;">

<h2>Target Audience</h2>


<p>Young people, 26 and under, parents with kids of reading age and retired adult 65+ that would like to cultivate another avenue for social interaction and continue their lifelong learning. </p>

<h2>Client/User Needs</h2>

<p>The client would like to get visitors to become  library card holders and motivate them to get into reading by showcasing popular books and offering unique services. Testimonials of these offering and services are one way to pass the message along. The visitors want to see just what this library has to offer above and beyond the checking out of media.</p>

<h2>Critique</h2>

<p>The testimonial area happens to exist further down on the page in this example but it stands out for a couple of reasons, more so than many other sites. First, if you happen to take a look at the overall site design it sits within a vertical band of alternating and contrasting elements, each of which extends to either end of the page so none of the elements have to compete for space on their left or right margins. The content above and below testimonials has a white background so the contrast with adjacent elements and the total size devoted to it definitely marks this as a key feature of the site, even if it is further down the page. The testimonial verbiage occupies the foreground position and there is plenty of negative space around the verbiage to highlight it as an important item of interest. Technically the background is a blurred image so that may not count as negative space but it has a similar effect. Supplying a photo of the person who provided the testimony is also a nice touch and adds a sense of legitimacy. </p>

<h2 id="title">What's New</h2>

<img src="images/whats_new.png" alt="Layout and Images" style="width:75%;height:4%;">

<h2>Target Audience</h2>


<p>This particular site is for the posh high-class country club crowd, old money or new ages 21 and up, more than likely upper middle class and up. The primary audience is the wealthy and connected golfing crowd ages 30 to 65 however the additional facilities that allow for grand events opens this place up to a younger crowd for such things as marriages, anniversaries and birthdays etc.</p>

<h2>Client/User Needs</h2>

<p>The client is using this particular component to showcase some of the latest goings on including golfing events, auto and spa services and chefs specials. Clearly this is a mechanism to drive incremental revenue by getting members to participate in more activities but it could also be a used as a mechanism to entice potential members to explore the grounds. The users can scan this widget and quickly identify any activities of interest without having to be redirected to a another page to learn more.</p>

<h2>Critique</h2>

<p>This feature has a symmetrical 3 by 3 grid pattern with alternating logos and items of interest. The orange background of the logo alludes to energy and warmth, which is certainly appropriate for a venue centered on outdoor activity. The feature itself has a nice dynamic aspect, a light animation that not only entices the user to interact it also provides additional information about the item that is being moused over via a sliding transparent overlay that matches the color scheme and dimensions of the information tile it sits on top of. You can essentially have your cake and eat it to, you can present a well-planned image to suggest at the service and then offer a layover to provide additional details.</p>

<h2 id="title">About Me/Us</h2>

<img src="images/aboutme.png" alt="Layout and Images" style="width:75%;height:4%;">

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>Any person or business interested in getting to know a person or company more. That is every demographic with the exception of 8 and under I would imagine.</p></br>

<h2>Client/User Needs</h2>

<p>The client is trying to accomplish a simple but effective showcasing of skills or services that includes more than verbiage but also some animation. The user wants to be able to quickly assess whether or not they are interested in doing business with the vendor. If it is an informational site this could assist with the decision by the visitor of spending more time on the site.</p>

<h2>Critique</h2>

<p> What better way to showcase some of your skills and attract attention than by providing rotating three-dimensional object? In this case each side of the object could represent a competency that the individual or company has. It is an animation with a message. The animation is balanced nicely with the verbiage on the left so one is just as predisposed to evaluate the claims in the paragraph as they are in the animation.</p>

<h2 id="title">Nav/Layout</h2>

<img src="images/newquest_navigation.png" alt="Layout and Images" style="width:75%;height:4%;">

<h2>Target Audience</h2>


<p>Medium to Large businesses with 10+ M gross annual revenue that would like have a professional design and development firm to produce their website. </p>


<h2>Client/User Needs</h2>

<p>Ultimately the client would like to be able to sell their design and development services to businesses. With regards to this particular page/nav layout the client wants to provide a way for their users to organize the content tiles that allow the users to interact with the site. They would also like the users to be able to interact with initial truncated content without moving the user to another page. Once the user is satisfied that they have found want they want they can then choose to be directed to another page if they require more information. The user needs to be able to engage with all of the various features of the site, some of which are more frequently used then others. Examples include shopping for ecommerce solutions, researching use cases and reviewing Twitter posts.</p>

<h2>Critique</h2>

<p>I have to admit, at first I had absolutely no idea what this site was about or to whom it was targeted. Part of that is due to French localization I am sure but even if I encountered the site in English at first it might have taken me a second. A good designer would say that is reason enough to walk away and they would probably be right but I chose to give the site a deeper look. I have to say, other than the concept of a grid, in this case a 4x10 grid to be exact; no other design principles stand out other than contrast within the icons and of course the icons themselves. It is rather chaotic. Within only a few seconds though it is apparent that the page is this way precisely because the client wishes to offer a very customizable and interactive home page. You quickly realize via the grid queues when you click on an object that the content tiles can be moved and organized in any way you wish. You can set up your own grids. It is definitely very functional, especially for returning visitors but I do not find it aesthetically pleasing. It is basically a collection of icons with simple color schemes but I like the rebelliousness of this design and what it offers in terms of obtaining information quickly as well as the ability to essentially customize where the content appears on the page. I think the old school VW bus is one of the ugliest things on the planet but you cannot deny it gets a lot of hippies to the commune when needed. I may abandon this as a component I wish to create simply because I cannot readily envision anymore than about 20% of the code necessary to pull it off but I have decided to keep it here for now for the reasons stated.</p>

<h2 id="title">Footer</h2>

<img src="images/Footer.png" alt="Layout and Images" style="width:75%;height:4%;">

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>Any company or individual interested in engaging with the person or individual whose site they are perusing.</p>

<h2>Client/User Needs</h2>

<p>For this component the client wants to insure that the user can contact the company, sign up for an email newsletter and engage in social media all in order to facilitate a contract sale. The user wants to be able to obtain more information via all of these same mechanisms in order to make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Critique</h2>

<p>If I ever tell you that I have spent more than 5 minutes thinking about footers I would be lying. I think I have spent a total of one minute to date. After seeing this footer I had to ask myself why. Perhaps it depends on the site you are on and what you are trying to get from it. Usually if I am after a footer I am looking for contact information to either find someone to solve my problem or to explore an opportunity. In the case of the former you may be dealing with a service site that wants to make it hard to find contact info while a sales site wants to make it easy. This site is clearly a sales site in that case. The font is not of size legal and the icons are bright and contrast strongly with the background resulting in the fastest phone find time of any footer I have ever seen. Through the Gestalt principle of grouping and the use of grids each piece of relevant information is discreetly organized and easily discernible. The white font contrasts sharply with the black background and is therefore easy to read as well. </p>

<h2 id="title">Calendar</h2>

<img src="images/calendar.png" alt="Layout and Images" style="width:75%;height:4%;">

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>The site is geared towards both upper middle class consumers and businesses. Individuals in the 30 to 65 year old range making 120k+ a year and businesses of all kinds. The calendar event taken out of context from this site could of course be appropriate for any number of sites.  </p>

<h2>Client/User Needs</h2>

<p>The intent of the site is to secure landscaping contracts across a range of clientele both personal and business. The images they have posted varies from garden steps to full on golf courses. The calendar in particular affords the client a means by which they can broadcast engagement opportunities with potential client beyond just visiting the website or making a call. The users need to able to identify the types and scopes of work available to them. This particular widget allows them to work towards that goal by affording them the opportunity to discover local events that could educate them about the products and services the company offers.</p>

<h2>Critique</h2>

<p>I like this future events calendar because it is clean and uncluttered. A brief description of each event sits center stage and is easy to read with contrasting white font on a slate gray background. If one is interested in the event it is rather easy to immediately confirm the date since the font is larger and in bold but not so large that you focus in the date first. One can also interact with each event to get more information via the modal window, which is evidenced by the arrows at the far right of each box. You could have easily missed those indicators given their low prominence in the widget if you did not want to explore more but if you were really interested you could also easily find them. Functionally speaking I like how you can explore each event without leaving the page. This may only work because they have few events in any given year, if they have 50 or so I can't imagine they are going to want to have 50 event bars stacked on each other so in that case there may need to be another option for the entire year which does direct you elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="title">Home Page Hero</h2>

<img src="images/homepage_hero.png" alt="Layout and Images" style="width:75%;height:4%;">

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>Cycling enthusiasts ages 18 to 45 of varying socio economic backgrounds but more than likely middle class and up. The target market for the clientele is also geographically localized to mountainous states such as Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.</p>

<h2>Client/User Needs</h2>

<p>The client wants to sell more bikes and equipment and insure a successful roll out of their latest lines. The users want to be able to purchase the equipment and research the latest offerings.</p>

<h2>Critique</h2>

<p>What struck me about this home page hero is its sense of visual hierarchy. You can't help but want to follow the biker as he goes deeper down into the trail. I suspect this would produce a little bit of longing to get back on to the trail. As your eyes scan right you see the real intent of the image and that is to expose you to the bike frame they want to sell which has a dramatic angular design, just like the home page hero. The bike is also slightly obscured by the red filtering, just enough so that it doesn't work against the visual hierarchy. Finally, as your eyes come off the bike and back to center you see the drop down arrow that allows you to begin exploring the site. And engaging banner that naturally guides your eyes to where you need to go to beging your investigation of the latest and greatest bike frame. </p>
